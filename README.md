Aspiring Javascript ecosystem developer, currently focused on wrapping my brain around how much things have changed since I did JS/PHP dev work as a student 15 years ago. Currently focused on learning the basics of userscript and browser extension design and all the many many frameworks, libraries, and other layers of complexity that have made Javascript more flexible, powerful, and maddening to use than ever. 

Don't expect any useful repos from me anytime soon, if I post anything in the near future it'll be broken or incomplete code I'm seeking guidance on. If anyone stumbles upon this mostly blank profile and feels like offering advice on good starter projects, first frameworks/libs to focus on learning, or anything else that might be helpful, I can be reached at ryanjbach@gmail.com (or right here on github, assuming it has some sort of DM feature? Speaking of which, another thing I'm in the process of learning is the absolute basics of git and github - I understand the basic concept more or less, but I've never used any sort of code repository / version control system before, I'm used to writing code in a text editor and uploading it directly to an internal testing server. I still get push and pull requests mixed up almost every time they're referenced. I expect I'll figure that stuff out pretty quickly once I have some code of my own worth sharing or sufficient knowledge and skill to feel like I could make useful contributions to other projects. 

TL;DR I'm new to (modern) JS and still in the early learning/tinkering phase so expect anything I post here to be a broken mess I'd like help with, not good code you should use for anything yourself ;)
